My first big programming project. This wasn't the final working version but we were writing everything on Vim and then cp-ing it to google docs and this version was the most easily accessible in a folder marked "For Tinling".
Maybe one day I'll be motivated enough to comb through the mess of "might-work.c" and "definitelythisoneisthefinalworkingone.h" filenames because I remember being quite proud of this project. Workflow is an important aspect of programming.
